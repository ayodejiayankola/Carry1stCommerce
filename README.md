### üè∑Ô∏è Tag: v1.0.0-assessment
**Initial release** featuring a quick prototype implementation of the app's core functionality.  

--- 

#### üöÄ Features  
- **Product Listing**:  
  - Grid layout using `LazyVGrid` for efficient product display.  
  - Dynamic product display leveraging image caching for performance optimization.  

- **Product Details**:  
  - Product information required shown.  
  - "Add to Cart" functionality with real-time cart updates.  

- **Cart Management**:  
  - Manage items with quantity adjustments and limits.  
  - Real-time total price calculation.  
  - Persistent cart state across sessions, ensuring continuity even after app restarts.  
  - User-friendly empty cart state with navigation options.  

- **Localization**:  
  - Centralized string management supports future multiple languages for global scalability.

### üèó Architectural Decisions
#### Architecture Pattern

- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): Separates concerns and provides a clean, testable architecture
- Dependency Injection implemented through protocols and initializer injection
- Uses Swift's async/await for asynchronous operations

#### Dependency Injection

- APIServiceable protocol for network services
- CartServiceProtocol for cart management
- Mock services for testing and preview
- Constructor-based dependency injection to improve testability

#### Networking

- Custom HTTPClient protocol for flexible network requests
- Centralized error handling with RequestError enum
- Uses URLSession for network calls
- Supports both live and mock API services


---

### üß™ Testing Strategy  

#### **Unit Tests**  
- **Networking Layer**: Verifies successful responses, error handling, and recovery strategies.  
- **Cart Management**: Validates item addition, removal, quantity adjustments, and price calculations.  
- **ViewModels**: Tests state initialization, data fetching, and error handling.  

#### **Tools**  
- XCTest for comprehensive test coverage across all layers of the app.  

---

### üîß Technical Highlights  
- **Modern Swift Concurrency**: Async/await simplifies asynchronous operations.  
- **Robust Networking Layer**:  
  - Protocol-based architecture enables flexibility and testability.  
  - Unified `RequestError` handles all network-related issues with user-friendly feedback.  
- **Efficient State Management**: USing `@Published`, `@StateObject`, and `EnvironmentObject` for dynamic UI updates.  
- **Image Caching**: Improving performance by reducing redundant network calls.  
- **Dynamic Light/Dark Mode**: Seamlessly adapts to user preferences.  

---

### üåê API Integration  

- Utilizes a [mock JSON server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/carry1stdeveloper/mock-product-api/productBundles) for consistent and reliable product data.  
- The mock API endpoint provides product bundle details, simulating real-world server interactions.  
- Flexible endpoint configuration to simplify future integration with a live backend.  

---

### üé® UI/UX Design  
- **Dark and Light Mode**: Ensures optimal readability in all conditions.  
- **Responsive Layouts**: Intuitive grid design adapts to various screen sizes.  
- **Error Feedback**: Clear, actionable messages guide users during connectivity issues.  

---

### üöß Performance Optimizations  
- **Image Caching**: Reduces load times and optimizes network usage.  
- **Lazy Loading**: Ensures smooth scrolling and faster initial load times.  
- **Optimized State Management**: Minimizes unnecessary view updates, improving app responsiveness.  

---

### üîç Future Improvements  
- Offline support for products and cart functionality.  
- Advanced product filtering and sorting options.  
- Persistent cart storage using Core Data or Realm.  
- Discount and promotion application at checkout.  
- Complete checkout implementation for a seamless e-commerce experience.

### üìä System Design Diagram  
The app architecture emphasizes modularity and scalability. It follows MVVM principles, where the UI layer interacts exclusively with ViewModels. These ViewModels mediate between the UI and service layers, ensuring clean separation of concerns.  

![System Design](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ef072d0-a9df-41ac-ab54-b6003b9a1d34)  

## üìù Assumptions
1. The mock API provides accurate and stable data.
2. Cart operations are session-based and do not persist across app launches.
3. The "Buy Now" button is a placeholder without functional implementation for this prototype.
